FLUTE TYPE,DESCRIPTION
Two Flute,The two-flute end mill has the greatest amount of flute space allowing for more chip carrying capacity. Used primarily in slotting and pocketing of non-ferrous materials where chip removal is a concern.
Three Flute,"While this tool has the same flute space as two flutes, it has a larger cross-sectional area providing for greater strength and the ability to pocket and slot both ferrous and non-ferrous materials."
Four / Multiple Flute,"Ideal for peripheral and finish milling. The additional flutes allow faster feed rates, but due to the reduced flute space, chip removal may be a problem. Produces a much finer finish than two and three flute tools."
